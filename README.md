<h2>Project Details</h2>

<h4>ðŸ”¶CyrusWebSolutions.com</h4>
<h6>Not Live: In Development</h6>
This is my personal brand and portfolio, where I showcase all of my web development work.

<h4>ðŸ”¶mySoftwareCo.com</h4>
<h6>Not Live: In Development</h6>
The home for the "my" series of appsâ€”web applications aimed at improving productivity and organization. The "my" series of apps under mySoftwareCo plays on the idea of personalization and ownership. Each app starts with "my" to signify that it is built for the individual user, making it feel like a personal tool. It's a fun play on words, where "my" represents both the user's possession and the name of my companyâ€”emphasizing that these apps are designed with the user in mind, for their personal use and benefit.

<h4>ðŸ”¸myStudyBuddy.app</h4>
<h6>Not Live: In Development</h6>
An app that helps users set and track study goals, offering tailored tools for subjects like programming, STEM, and memorization.

<h4>ðŸ”¸myLifeBuddy.app</h4>
<h6>Not Live: In Development</h6>
A life organization app featuring task management, habit tracking, and goal setting to help users manage their personal lives.

<h4>ðŸ”¸myCardVault.app</h4>
<h6>Not Live: In Development</h6>
A digital sports card inventory system that lets users store, organize, and search their physical card collections online using filters, tags, and searches. It helps users track where cards are stored physically, making it less overwhelming to manage large collections.

<h4>ðŸ”¸myOneAccount.com</h4>
<h6>Not Live: In Development</h6>
A central account system for all of my apps. With one account, users can log in and access any of the "my" apps seamlessly, unifying their experience across all of the websites.

<h4>ðŸ”¶WhatGamersThink.com</h4>
<h6>Not Live: In Development</h6>
A platform for gamers to voice opinions on games, mechanics, and studios by creating and voting on petitions and polls.

<h4>ðŸ”¶theOfficeFanClub.com</h4>
<h6>Not Live: In Development</h6>
A community for fans of The Office to connect, share, and celebrate their love for the show.
